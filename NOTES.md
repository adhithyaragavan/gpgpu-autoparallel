# Design Decisions & Scope Log

Running log of real decisions and simplifications, in the order made. This becomes the basis of the
finale writeup — each entry should be a decision plus the reasoning, not just a fact.

## Format for entries

```
### <date> — <short title>
**Decision:** what was decided.
**Reasoning:** why, including what tradeoff was accepted.
**Alternative considered:** what else was possible and why it was rejected (if relevant).

### Day 0 — Clang LibTooling instead of ROSE

**Decision:** Build on Clang LibTooling rather than the ROSE framework suggested in the original brief.

**Reasoning:** ROSE's main relevant strength — native parsing of programs that already contain
CUDA/OpenMP/UPC syntax — doesn't apply to this project, since the input is plain sequential C/C++ and
the tool *generates* OpenMP directives rather than parsing existing GPU code. ROSE's build setup is a
known, disproportionate time sink, which is an unacceptable risk on a solo, time-boxed build. Clang
LibTooling provides equivalent source-level AST traversal and source-to-source rewriting (via
`RecursiveASTVisitor`/`ASTMatchers` + `Rewriter`), is far better documented, and has a much lower setup
cost.

**Alternative considered:** Sticking with ROSE as specified in the brief. Rejected due to build-time risk
outweighing the (largely inapplicable) CUDA-awareness benefit for this specific input domain.
